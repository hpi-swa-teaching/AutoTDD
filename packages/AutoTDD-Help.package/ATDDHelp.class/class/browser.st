			'The browser is the primary form of interacting with AutoTDD. It contains a list of all of your locally defined watchers as well as any Travis statuses and GitHub actions which you have added. Testing entities are managed from this GUI; this includes adding, editing, removing, and inspecting testing entities. All of your watchers are saved upon closing the browser as well as your image.
			
The browser can be opened at any time by clicking on "Apps -> Test Auto Runner" in the upper menu bar.'
